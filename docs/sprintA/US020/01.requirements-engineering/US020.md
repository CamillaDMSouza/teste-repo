# US020 - View the time with the highest number of posts in a day


## 1. Requirements Engineering
* As a member, I want to have a delete button on the the Member Details area, so that I can delete a user.*

### 1.1. User Story Description

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

As a member of the system, I want to be able to view the time when there was the highest number of posts on a given day, so that I can identify the most active moments on the platform.

**From the client clarifications:**


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria
 **AC1:**There should be a user interface where I can select the day to view.
 **AC2:**After selecting the day, I should be able to see the time with the highest number of posts.
 **AC3:**If there is a tie between times with the same maximum number of posts, the system should display all of those times.
 **AC4:**The information should be presented in a clear and readable manner for the user.
 **AC5:**The functionality should be intuitive and easy to use.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer | Justification (with patterns) |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----- | :---------------------------- |
| Step 1         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 2         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 3         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 4         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 5         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 6         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 7         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 8         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 9         |                                             |        |                               |
| Step 10        |                                             |        |                               |

### Systematization

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

- Class1
- Class2
- Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

- xxxxUI
- xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement._

![USXXX-SD](USXXX-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods._

![USXXX-CD](USXXX-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests

_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    	public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
    	Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
    }

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._

# 6. Integration and Demo

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._

# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
